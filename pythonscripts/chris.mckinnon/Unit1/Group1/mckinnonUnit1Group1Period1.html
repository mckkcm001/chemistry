    An average calculated for multiple measurements has some uncertainty. 
    If we made more measurements, the average might change a bit. 
    To estimate how much it might change, that is, to calculate the uncertainty,

    The precision error of a repeated measurement is a comparison of the uncertainty

    Any fraction multiplied by 100 turns the fraction into a percentage, also called parts per hundred.
    The percent precision error is the uncertainty divided by the average times 100.
